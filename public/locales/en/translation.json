        "question": "Does ear piercing hurt?",
        "answer": "The Inverness MED system is exceptionally gentle and much less painful than traditional gun. The earring gently separates tissue instead of puncturing it, making discomfort minimal. Most of our clients agree that the procedure is virtually painless."
      },
      {
        "question": "From what age can children's ears be pierced?",
        "answer": "The Inverness MED system is doctor-approved for ear piercing in children from 0+. It is the only system in Europe with such certification. The quiet, precise mechanism doesn't scare the youngest, and 100% sterility guarantees safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does healing take after piercing?",
        "answer": "For earlobes, healing takes about 6-8 weeks. For cartilage piercing (helix, tragus, conch), the healing process can take 3-6 months. Inverness MED system speeds up healing thanks to precise, atraumatic piercing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the Inverness MED system safe?",
        "answer": "Yes! The Inverness MED system has international FDA and ISO certificates, confirming the highest quality and safety standards. We use single-use, closed sterile cassettes, which guarantees 100% sterility."
      },
      {
        "question": "What earrings are available?",
        "answer": "Our offer includes over 30 earring models made of titanium, niobium or medical steel. All are hypoallergenic and have REACH certificate. We have earrings for both children and adults in various styles and colors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to prepare for the visit?",
        "answer": "No special preparation is required. We recommend coming with clean ears and tied hair or the ability to tie them. For children, it's worth explaining beforehand what the procedure will look like so they feel calm."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does ear piercing cost?",
        "answer": "The procedure price starts from 130 PLN for piercing two earlobes. The cost of earrings must be added to the price ‚Äî from 90 to 150 PLN per pair. We also offer mobile service with home visit (+50 PLN). You'll find the current price list in the 'Our services' section."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pierce cartilage (helix, tragus)?",
        "answer": "Yes! We specialize in ear cartilage piercing, including helix, tragus and conch. The Inverness MED system is particularly suitable for this type of piercing because it is precise and doesn't tear tissue like a typical gun."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to care for pierced ears?",
        "answer": "After piercing, you will receive detailed care instructions. Basic rules are: washing hands before touching earrings, gentle cleaning 2 times a day with special solution, avoiding pools and water bodies for the first 2 weeks, and regular earring rotation.",
